# Introduction

## Key Concepts and Definitions
### In the context of design and digital art, "color palette," "color library," and "color swatch" each refer to different concepts related to the use and organization of colors:
### * Color Palette: This refers to a specific set of colors chosen for a particular design or collection of artworks. A color palette is often limited to a few harmonious colors selected to convey a specific mood, style, or brand identity. Designers use these palettes to maintain consistency across their work.
### * Color Library: This is a broader collection of color palettes and individual colors that can be used across various projects. A color library may contain numerous palettes and standalone colors that a designer or a team can access for different needs. This library serves as a resource for finding the perfect colors for any design scenario.
### * Color Swatch: A color swatch is a sample of a color used to show how it looks in real use; it can be a physical piece (like fabric or paint chip) or digital. In digital design, a swatch is typically a small block of color that designers can click to select that color for use in their artwork or designs. Swatches are parts of a palette or can be stored in a color library for repeated use.
### These tools are integral to the design process, helping professionals keep their work visually cohesive and aligned with their intended aesthetic.

### The following features are based on the distinction between them:
### * Color Library allows you to choose one or more base colors that match a given critera;
### * Color Palette to choose which color variations work well together and suit the intended aesthetic of your project. 
### * Color Swatch feature enables users to preview how their selected colors will appear in production, helping them make informed decisions about their design choices."
